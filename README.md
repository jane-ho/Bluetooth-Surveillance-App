# bluetooth-example-app

### Introduction:
This app is for the tutorial of writing an Android app using BlueTooth. It is written in the way to demo 

* multiple modules in android studio project - exampleApp and libBT
* multiple activites - main activity and scanning bluetooth device activity
* organizes java classes into different packages for different purposes.
* implmentment of custom view - protocol selection spinner
* using fragments for static and dynamic UI - front page fragment and the control fragment
* using Timer and TimerTask for periodical data trasmssion
* using constraint layout to layout UI views by Android UI editor
* using RecycleView to hold scanned BlueTooth remote devices
* using action/tool bar menu 
* using share perferences for storing activtie lifecycle states - keeping bluetooth connection while activitys are started and destroyed
* using BlueTooth SPP and BLE API
* using Log for debugging - android studio logcat

### Prerequisites:
